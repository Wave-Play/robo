# Using act to locally test

We are using act to locally test CI, it is easier and faster that way though
some setup is required.

https://nektosact.com/

At the root of the folder you need two files.

```.env``` and ```act.vault```

content of ```.env``` for example:

```GITHUB_REPOSITORY="Nazeofel/robo"```


content of ```act.vault``` for example:

```
GH_TOKEN=Your Github token
```

.env is used for variables as it emulates github's.
.vault is used for secrets.


if you wish to test another file or add a test case

please refer to the act_local.ts file and follow the protocol.
