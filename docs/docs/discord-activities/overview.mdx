# Discord Activities Overview

**Robo.js** is a powerful framework that allows you to create **[Discord Activities](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord)** with ease, **[among other things](../discord-bots/overview)**. This section will explain all the concepts behind them, and how they are simplified with Robo.js.

## Getting Started

Ready to embark on this adventure? Creating a Discord Activity with Robo.js is as easy as running one command.

```bash
npx create-robo <projectName> -k activity
```

This will walk you through setting up your project and installing the necessary dependencies. Once selected, you can run and start developing your Discord Activity right away!

## What are Discord Activities?

Discord Activities are web apps that run inside Discord. They can be games, quizzes, or any other type of interactive content that users can play with.

Activities can be built using **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)**, **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)**, and **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**, alongside any frontend framework such as **[React](https://react.dev/)**, **[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)**, **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**, or none at all. They use **[Discord's Embedded App SDK](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/)** to interact with Discord APIs.

## How does Robo.js help?

Robo.js simplifies the process by providing an ecosystem of plugins and features to help you build your Discord Activity faster and more efficiently. It is designed to be simple and easy to use.

Here's what you can expect:

- **[One Project](../robojs/files)**: Everything is in one place, making it easy to manage. No more separate backend and frontend projects.
- **[Integrated Database](../robojs/flashcore)**: Robo.js has an built-in KV database that can be pointed to any data source via adapters.
- **[TypeScript Support](../create-robo/typescript)**: TypeScript works out of the box, so you can use it without any additional setup.
- **[Built-in Tunnels](./tunnels)**: The Robo CLI automatically sets up free Cloudflare tunnels for easy testing.
- **[Plugin System](../plugins/overview)**: Extend your activity's features with plugins that seamlessly add new functionality.
- **[Easy Hosting](../hosting/overview)**: Deploy your activity for others to use with just one command, or self-host it on your own.
- **[Ecosystem](../plugins/overview)**: A growing ecosystem of plugins, templates, and tools to help you build faster with less effort.
