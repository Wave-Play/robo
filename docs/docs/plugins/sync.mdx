# @robojs/sync

Real-time state sync across clients the simplest way possible. Perfect for multiplayer games and chat apps. It's like magic, but real! ðŸŽ©âœ¨

```ts
const [position, setPosition] = useSyncState({ x: 0, y: 0 }, [channelId])
```

It works exactly like React's `useState`, but it syncs the state across all clients in real-time using websockets, sharing the same state across all clients with the same dependency array. (In this case, `[channelId]`)

No more manual websocket handling or state synchronization. Just focus on building your app and let `@robojs/sync` handle the rest. It works out of the box as long as you also have the `@robojs/server` plugin installed.

## Installation 

To install this plugin, navigate to your existing Robo project's directory and run the following command:

<Terminal execute>{`robo add @robojs/sync`}</Terminal>

> **Note:** You will also need to install the `@robojs/server`.

That's it! You can now start using `useSyncState` in your project. Just wrap your App component with the `SyncContextProvider` and you're good to go!

```tsx
import { SyncContextProvider } from '@robojs/sync'

export function App() {
	return (
		<SyncContextProvider>
			<Activity />
		</SyncContextProvider>
	)
}
```

## Usage 

Here's a simple example of how you can use `useSyncState` in your project to share the mouse position across all clients:

```tsx
import { useSyncState } from '@robojs/sync'
import { useDiscordSdk } from '../hooks/useDiscordSdk'

export function Player() {
	const { session } = useDiscordSdk()
	const [position, setPosition] = useSyncState({ x: 0, y: 0 }, ['position'])

	const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
		setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY })
	}

	return (
		<div
			onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
			style={{
				width: '100vw',
				height: '100vh'
			}}
		>
			<div
				style={{
					position: 'absolute',
					left: position.x,
					top: position.y
				}}
			>
				Player
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

The provider accepts an optional `loadingScreen` prop, which is a component to display while the websocket connection is being established.

```tsx
<SyncContextProvider loadingScreen={<LoadingScreen />}>
	<Activity />
</SyncContextProvider>
```

We also expose a way to manually start and get the websocket connection:

```tsx
import { SyncServer } from '@robojs/sync/server.js'

// To manually start the websocket server
SyncServer.start()

// To get the underlying websocket server
const wss = SyncServer.getSocketServer()
```
