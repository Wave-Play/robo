# ðŸŒŸ Creating Plugins

Developing a Robo plugin works in the same way as developing features for a Robo.

To create a new plugin project, run the following command:

<Terminal create>your-awesome-robo-plugin --plugin</Terminal>

ðŸ”‘ Make sure to include the `--plugin` flag, as it's essential for creating a new Plugin project.

### Testing Your Plugin ðŸ§ª

To test your plugin during development, you can install it from your local directory in a test Robo project. First, navigate to your test Robo project's directory and run the following command:

<Terminal execute>robo add /path/to/your-awesome-robo-plugin</Terminal>

> **Heads up:** On Windows, the path may look like this instead: `C:\path\to\your-awesome-robo-plugin`

Replace `/path/to/your-awesome-robo-plugin` with the actual path to your plugin's directory. Remember to build your plugin between changes using the `robo build plugin` command.

You can use the `--watch` flag to automatically rebuild your plugin when changes are detected. This is the recommended way to develop your plugin, as it provides a smoother development experience. If your test Robo is also running in dev mode, it will auto-reload when your plugin is rebuilt.

<Terminal execute>robo build plugin --watch</Terminal>

### Building the Plugin ðŸ”¨

Robo comes with a built-in compiler to help you package your plugin for distribution. To build your plugin, run the following command:

<Terminal execute>robo build plugin</Terminal>

This will compile your plugin and prepare it for publishing to NPM.

### Publishing to NPM ðŸ“¦

Once you've built your plugin using `robo build plugin`, you're ready to publish it to NPM. Make sure you've set up your NPM account and are logged in through the CLI.

Run the following command to publish your plugin:

<Terminal>npm publish</Terminal>

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Your plugin is now available on NPM for other Robo.js users to install and enjoy.

Remember to **keep sensitive information out of your plugin**. Avoid including any `.env` files or similar data that should not be shared with other users.
