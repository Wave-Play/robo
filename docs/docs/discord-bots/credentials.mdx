# ðŸ”‘ Discord Bot Credentials

For your **Discord Bot** to work, you need to set up a few **environment variables** to authenticate with **Discord**.

These are secret values that you should never share with anyone. They're stored in a `.env` file, which is automatically loaded by **Robo.js** when you start your project.

## What You Need

Get the following environment variables from the **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)**.

### Client ID

This is your **Discord Application ID**, found in the **Discord Developer Portal**. Sign in with your **Discord** account, click on your bot application, and find the **Application ID** in the **General Information** tab.

In your `.env` file, add the following line:

```bash title=".env"
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="your_application_id"
```

:::tip Reminder

Don't forget to replace `your_application_id` with the value you just obtained!

### Discord Bot Token

This is your **Discord Bot Token**, found in the **Bot** tab of your app under the **Token** section near the top. You may need to reveal it by clicking **Reset Token**.

In your `.env` file, add the following line:

```bash title=".env"
DISCORD_TOKEN="your_bot_token"
```

## Optional Variables

The environment variables below are not strictly necessary, but they're sure to make your life easier during development and testing.

### DISCORD_GUILD_ID

Setting up a `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` environment variable is a neat trick for testing. It ensures that any new commands you create only get applied to the Discord server this ID belongs to. To get the `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`, follow these steps:

1. Open Discord and navigate to the server you want to use.
2. Right-click the server icon and click "Copy ID."

In your `.env` file, add the following line:

```bash title=".env"
DISCORD_GUILD_ID={your_guild_id}
```

Replace `{your_guild_id}` with the value you just obtained.

### DISCORD_DEBUG_CHANNEL_ID

The `DISCORD_DEBUG_CHANNEL_ID` environment variable is useful for directing errors to a specific channel during development. This helps developers focus on the task at hand and handle async errors that may occur during development and are out of their control. To get the `DISCORD_DEBUG_CHANNEL_ID`, follow these steps:

1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord by going to User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode.
2. Navigate to the channel you want to use as your debug channel.
3. Right-click the channel and click "Copy ID."

In your `.env` file, add the following line:

```bash title=".env"
DISCORD_DEBUG_CHANNEL_ID={your_debug_channel_id}
```

Remember to replace `{your_debug_channel_id}` with the value you just obtained.

:::warning ðŸš¨ Note

Using `DISCORD_DEBUG_CHANNEL_ID` is not strictly necessary, and we gently discourage its use. You shouldn't just shove errors away in a place where you can ignore them. Instead, check out the [Debugging Documentation](./debug) to learn how to handle errors effectively.

## Enabling Developer Mode in Discord

Enabling Developer Mode in Discord allows you to access handy features, like copying IDs for servers, channels, and users. To enable Developer Mode, follow these simple steps:

1. Open Discord.
2. Click on the gear icon in the lower-left corner to open your User Settings.
3. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click on "Advanced."
4. Toggle on the "Developer Mode" switch.

That's it! You now have Developer Mode enabled, unlocking a world of possibilities for your bot development journey. ðŸš€

## Keep It Secure

Make sure to keep your `.env` file safe and never share it with anyone. If you accidentally expose your credentials, you can regenerate them in the **Discord Developer Portal**.

Remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being pushed to your repository.

```bash title=".gitignore"
.env
```

Don't worry, **Robo.js** will automatically load your environment variables when you start your project.
