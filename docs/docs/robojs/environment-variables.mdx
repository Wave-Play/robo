# ðŸ”‘ Environment Variables

Sometimes you need to store sensitive information, like API keys, database URLs, or **[Discord Credentials](#)**.

**Environment Variables** store these values outside of your codebase. They're loaded into your project when it starts, and are less likely to be exposed accidentally. Hardcoding them is a bad idea, as they risk being leaked.

## Standard File

**Robo** projects use a file called `.env`. This file is in the root of your project and can be used to store sensitive information.

Here's what it may look like:

```bash title=".env"
# Discord Credentials
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="your_application_id"
DISCORD_TOKEN="your_bot_token"

# My secret stuff
EXAMPLE_VARIABLE="Sshh, this is a secret!"
```

Variables are stored as key-value pairs, separated by an equals sign (`=`). The key is the name of the variable, and the value is the sensitive information. Access these values in your code using `process.env`.

```javascript title="/src/commands/secret.js"
export default () => {
	return process.env.EXAMPLE_VARIABLE ?? 'No secret found!'
}
```

:::warning

Be careful where you use `process.env` in your code. Don't expose sensitive information in logs or error messages!

## Security

What's so special about **Environment Variables**, you ask? Well, we didn't invent them, the concept has been around for a while. Smart developers (like you) have built tools and practices around them over the years.

Here's a few reasons why they're a good idea:

- **Access Control**: You can control who has access to your `.env` file, and who can see the values inside.
- **Audit Trails**: You can track changes to your `.env` file, showing who changed what and when.
- **Isolation**: Sensitive information is kept separate from your code, reducing the risk of accidental leaks.
- **Version Control**: You can exclude `.env` from your version control system like **[GitHub](https://github.com)**.

For those using **Git**, know that **Robo** comes with an optimized `.gitignore`.

## Modes and Variables

Complex projects may want to use different environment variables for different cases. **Robo** supports this with **[Modes](./mode)**!

Suffix your `.env` file with the mode you want to use, like `.env.production` or `.env.development`. **Robo** will automatically load the correct file based on the mode you're running.

```bash title=".env.production"
DEBUG_STUFF="false"
EXAMPLE_VARIABLE="Hello, production!"
```

```bash title=".env.development"
DEBUG_STUFF="true"
EXAMPLE_VARIABLE="Hello, development!"
```

Depending on if you ran `robo dev` or `robo start`, you'll see different output.

```javascript title="/src/commands/secret.js"
export default () => {
	return process.env.EXAMPLE_VARIABLE ?? 'No secret found!'
}
```

## Env API

Although **Robo.js** manages your **Environment Variables** automatically, it also exports an API for more control.

```javascript
import { Env } from 'robo.js'
```

| Method       | Description                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Constructor  | Creates a structured schema.         |
| `load()`     | Load the `.env` file.               |
| `loadSync()` | Load the `.env` file synchronously. |
| `data()`     | Get all loaded variables.           |

### Loading Variables

**Robo.js** automatically loads your `.env` file when your project starts. Access these in your code using `process.env`.

```javascript title="/src/events/_start.js"
export default () => {
	// This is EXAMPLE_VARIABLE in your .env file
	console.log(process.env.EXAMPLE_VARIABLE)
}
```

You can load your `.env` file manually using the **Env** API.

```javascript title="/src/events/_start.js"
import { Env } from 'robo.js'

export default async () => {
	// Load the .env file
	await Env.load()

	// Can also be done as a blocking operation
	Env.loadSync()

	// This is EXAMPLE_VARIABLE in your .env file
	console.log(process.env.EXAMPLE_VARIABLE)

	// See only your Robo's loaded variables (ignores system ones)
	console.log(Env.data())
}
```

Change default behavior by passing an options object.

```javascript title="/src/events/_start.js"
await Env.load({
	// The mode to load environment variables for
	mode: 'production',

	// Whether to overwrite existing environment variables
	// Can be a boolean or an array of keys to overwrite
	overwrite: true,

	// The path to the environment file. Defaults to `.env`
	path: '/path/to/.env'
})
```

Both `load()` and `loadSync()` modify `process.env` directly, so you can access the variables anywhere in your project, and they return an object with the loaded variables.

Again, **Robo** already does this for you, so you don't need to worry about it unless you want to customize the behavior.

### Schema Builder

We find keeping track of every time we use `process.env` in our code to be a chore, so we built `Env` to help with that.

```javascript
import { Env } from 'robo.js'

const env = new Env({
	discord: {
		clientId: {
			env: 'DISCORD_CLIENT_ID'
		},
		token: {
			env: 'DISCORD_TOKEN'
		}
	},
	example: {
		default: 'Nothing to see here',
		env: 'EXAMPLE_VARIABLE'
	}
})
```

This creates a schema for the **Environment Variables** you want organized.

```javascript
// Use `get()` to access your variables
console.log(env.get('example'))

// Use dot notation for nested variables
console.log(env.get('discord.clientId'))

// Thanks to defaults, you can safely access variables
// `env.get('discord.clientId')` is the same as this, just cleaner
console.log(process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID ?? 'Nothing to see here')
```

Now you can rename or reorganize your `.env` file without breaking your code as you now update it in one place.

Plus, you get type checking with **[TypeScript](/robojs/typescript)**!
